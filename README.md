# Shitify
I needed a way to reasonably make absolutely dogshit quality audio for [Sitekick Remastered](https://sitekickremastered.com/).  We wanted a way of making audio that sounded like it was from a 2005 Youtube video, so I put together a script with ChatGPT that does just that.

# Requirements
 - Windows
 - ffmpeg

# Usage
Move all the mp3 files that you want to Shitify into a new folder.  Move shitify.bat to that folder.  Run the batch file et voila, it'll create a shitified folder with terrible audio in it.
